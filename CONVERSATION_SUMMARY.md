# Claude Asteroids AI - Conversation Summary

## Project Overview
This project implements a sophisticated AI system for playing Asteroids using Deep Q-Learning (DQN) with meta-learning capabilities and task decomposition.

## Key Development Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Meta-Learning Implementation
- Started with a DQN-based Asteroids AI that had already been upgraded from basic to include meta-learning
- Implemented 5 specialized neural networks for different game aspects
- Added curriculum learning with 15 progressive difficulty levels

### Phase 2: Performance Analysis & Debugging
- Discovered learning curve degradation issue
- Created comprehensive logging system (TrainingLogger) to track:
  - Episode metrics (score, survival time, accuracy)
  - Step-level details (loss, Q-values, rewards)
  - Parameter tracking throughout training
- Built analysis tools to visualize learning curves

### Phase 3: Parameter Optimization
- Identified epsilon decay issue (0.9998 too slow - still 97% exploration after 500 episodes)
- Created configurable parameter system with multiple presets:
  - **Default**: Original slow learning (epsilon_decay=0.9998)
  - **Fast Learning**: Aggressive parameters (epsilon_decay=0.99)
  - **Balanced Learning**: Optimal compromise (epsilon_decay=0.9995)
- Ran comparative experiments showing balanced approach works best

### Phase 4: Modular Framework Development
- Created game_ai_framework for transfer learning between games
- Implemented task decomposition with specialized agents:
  - **AvoidanceAgent**: Threat dodging and survival
  - **CombatAgent**: Targeting and shooting
  - **NavigationAgent**: Movement and positioning
- Built MetaLearningAgent to coordinate task agents
- Designed universal game interface for easy game addition
